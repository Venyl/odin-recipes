            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tablespoon (12 grams) granulated sugar
                </li>
                <li>
                    ¼ teaspoon salt
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 ½ cups (360 ml) whole milk
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 large eggs
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter , melted and slightly cooled (plus more for the pan)
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add all of the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, about 15 to 20 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at
                    least one hour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat an 8- to 9-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brush the skillet with some melted butter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lift the pan off of the heat and quickly pour a scant ¼ cup of the pancake mixture in the center of
                    the pan, swirling the pan in a circular motion so that the mixture evenly coats the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return the pan to the stovetop and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bottom is lightly browned
                    and the edges begin to lift from the pan. Carefully loosen with a spatula and flip to cook the other
                    side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the heat and slide the pancake onto a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining batter,
                    lightly
                    coating the pan with melted butter as needed. You may stack the cooked pancakes on top of each other
                    while the rest of the batter is cooking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Top with fresh fruit and dust with powdered sugar or fill with your favorite fillings.
                </li>
            </ol>
