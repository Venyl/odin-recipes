            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until
                    browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller
                    crumbles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for
                    about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom
                    of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring
                    the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and
                    taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil,
                    and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before
                    the suggested cooking time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave
                    for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan
                    sprinkled on top.
                </li>
            </ol>
